<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>i am Ashok 3rd-year CSE student learning web development and DSA, a great project idea would be to build a **Secure Online Coding Platform**. 
This platform would allow users to solve DSA problems in a real-time coding environment while incorporating features like user authentication, problem categorization, </p

<p>and performance tracking. You could use DSA concepts to implement features such as efficient problem recommendations, based on the user's skill level, using algorithms like binary search or dynamic programming.
 For the tech stack, React.js can handle the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. Additionally, </p>
<p> integrating a C++ compiler API or creating your own lightweight compiler backend could showcase your skills. 
 This project not only leverages your web development expertise but also demonstrates a strong grasp of DSA, making it an excellent choice for your resume and placement preparation.</p>
